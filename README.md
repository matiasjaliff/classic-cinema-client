# Classic Cinema - Frontend

**Classic Cinema** is a movie catalog with social network features. It's a fully functional three-tier website with a mobile first responsive design. The current repository is the **frontend** of the whole project. You can find the **backend** side in [this repository](https://github.com/matiasjaliff/Classic-Cinema).

Although the **backend** is almost finished, I am currently working in the **frontend**. I will be sharing more information soon.
